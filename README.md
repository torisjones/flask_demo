### Setup
To get this project running, you will need to have installed python (preferably python 3.6+) and
a text editor. 

1. Change directory to the base directory of this project
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 


To test that this worked successfully, change directories to `HelloWorld/basic` then run `python3 server.py` 
and go to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the text `Hello World!` displayed on your screen.

On linux/Mac os this looks like 
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd HelloWorld/basic/
python3 server.py
```
